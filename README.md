# Classification-based image segmentation-

The GUI allows to trained the classiefer like Gradient boost, Random forest SVM, and many other classifers to compare the performance. In addition, one can save the classifiers in two different format using pickel and joblic packages of python. However,labeling of data is major issue as I have not labelled data to test classifier for large data.
